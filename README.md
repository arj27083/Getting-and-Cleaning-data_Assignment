# Getting-and-Cleaning-data_Assignment
This is a part of evaluation of Coursera Project

The script in run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Sources the zip file from the internet and unzips it in the current working directory
2. Reads the data from both train and test
2. Extracts the required feature name and activity name along with their numbers
3. Merges the training and test set
4. Cleans the complete data and creates a .txt file of the cleaned data

To run the script, just copy and paste in your R window. After running, you will see the cleaned data created as a .txt and .csv file in the current directory
